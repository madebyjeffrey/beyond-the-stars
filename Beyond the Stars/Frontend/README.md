### Instructions

Use ``mkcert`` to generate a certificate that can run in your browser. Look up instructions on how to do this. Apologies, the router requires cryptographic functions that necessitate this.

Update vite.config.ts with the path to the pem files.

Run ``npm run dev`` to run the server from the FrontEnd directory inside the .net project.
